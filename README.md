# CSV_File_Analysis_and_Visualization

### Project Description:
The CSV File Analysis and Visualization tool is a Streamlit-based application designed to assist in analyzing CSV files containing student data. The objective is to offer insights through visualizations and summary statistics, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's characteristics.

### Installation Instructions:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Rajababuray/CSV_File_Analysis_and_Visualization-streamlit-.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Set up the Environment:**
   - Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
     ```
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
     venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
     ```
   - Install necessary dependencies:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```
   streamlit run stock_prediction.py
   ```

### Usage Information:
1. **Upload CSV File:**
   - Click on the sidebar to upload a CSV file containing student data.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Preprocessing steps are automatically executed upon file upload, displaying a preview of the dataset.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Summary Statistics: Provides an overview of statistical measures for numerical columns.
   - Correlation Heatmap: Displays correlations between numerical columns.

4. **Visualization Options after EDA:**
   - Choose various visualizations such as Histogram, Scatter Plot, Pie Chart, Bar Chart, Donut Chart, Violin Plot, Pair Plot, Line Plot, Density Plot.
   - Customize visualizations by selecting specific columns for analysis.

5. **Dashboard:**
   - Enable the checkbox to view a custom dashboard.
   - Dashboard includes summary statistics, count plot for a categorical column, and pair plots for numerical columns.
